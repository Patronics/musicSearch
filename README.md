# musicSearch
Search for and save music by name and artist, uses MusicBrainz API and localstorage.

Designed for identifying music from a streaming service to transfer to another one, when you can't easily access both services at once. 
For example, use it from a Tesla's browser when a song you want to add to a playlist comes up.

[Use it live with github.io here](https://patronics.github.io/musicSearch/musicSearch.html)

## usage
- To search by song name alone, simply type it in the search box and hit enter.
- To search by song name and artist, simply enter both in the search box, separated by a dash, in the form `song name - artist name`
- you can enter a subset of each, it doesn't need to be a complete song name or artist name. often just 1 or 2 words from each is enough to find the song you want!
- Press the `save` box to save a song for later, and `mark` to additionally flag it (such as to mark when you've transferred it to a different playlist).
